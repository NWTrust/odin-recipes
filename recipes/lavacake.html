        alt="A LAVA CAKE YUMM!">

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Chocolate lava cakes with their deliciously rich molten chocolate center come together with 6 simple ingredients.
        Ready in just 25 minutes, this surprisingly easy dessert always impresses. If you don’t have ramekins, follow
        our instructions for using a muffin pan instead.

        Today we’re making straight-up chocolate lava cakes. Even though peanut butter chocolate lava cakes are truly
        magical, we’ve received a lot of requests for a plain chocolate version. So we decided to make them. It IS
        chocolate molten lava cake, after all.

        Molten cakes are always a crowd favorite, and they’re infinitely better when freshly made at home. You’ll love
        that lava cakes are single servings just like chocolate cupcakes. If you prefer a gluten-free option, consider
        making rich and fudge-like flourless chocolate cake.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> ½ cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>

        <li>6 ½ (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>

        <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>

        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>

        <li>4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and flour four 6-ounce ramekins.</li>
        <li>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping
            down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes.
            Mix in melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and
            place on a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>    
    </ol>
